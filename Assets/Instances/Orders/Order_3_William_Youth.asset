  - Greetings, youngling
  - My bones, my arms, my whole body is very old and I am tired of it.
  - I want to be young again. Can you help me?
  <MessagesGoodResponse>k__BackingField:
  - Brilliant, you have my gratitude!
  - One life ends, a new one begins!
  <MessagesMehResponse>k__BackingField:
  - I feel as old as I was yesterday.
  - So technically it made me 24 hours younger.
  - Not exactly what i wanted tho.
  <MessagesBadResponse>k__BackingField:
  - That thing you gave me made me even older!
  - Everything is even worse now!
