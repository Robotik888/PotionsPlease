  - Hello, potioneer! I see you are doing great! Listen, we don't have enough money
    to buy all ingredients you need for your potions.
  - But thanks to your great work, I stole your Revert potion recipe from yesterday,
    improved it and combined it with good old machines.
  - You can see that on the left of your cauldron, there is a revertion box. This
    is your new help. It reverts effect of any ingredient, so you can mix more potions
    with less specific ingredients.
  - You simply put here ingredient and after reversal process, you will notice the
    revertion sign. Than you can use it as normally but with oposite effect.
  - 'Try this simple potion for me:'
  - In the past, you mixed love potion, now , cook for me Hate potion with use of
    ingredients from love potion (if you remember them).
  <MessagesGoodResponse>k__BackingField:
  - I see you are learning very fast. Enjoy your day with your new toy.
  - And remember that in future potions not all the ingredients must be reverted.
    You can revert from 0 to all.
  <MessagesMehResponse>k__BackingField:
  - There are some mistakes, but you are quite good.
  - And remember that in future potions not all the ingredients must be reverted.
    You can revert from 0 to all.
  <MessagesBadResponse>k__BackingField:
  - You dissapointed me.... Just try your best and you will see...
  - And remember that in future potions not all the ingredients must be reverted.
    You can revert from 0 to all.
