  - There have been a few buzzkills in my tavern lately.
  - Can you please make me someting I can mix in their drinks so they're not that
    grumpy anymore?
  - Something that adds some fun to their minds.
  <MessagesGoodResponse>k__BackingField:
  - Thanks, everyone is laughing having so much fun now!
  <MessagesMehResponse>k__BackingField:
  - At the very least, the number of complainants from those buzzkills has decreased.
  - But they still seem grumpy most the time.
  <MessagesBadResponse>k__BackingField:
  - This made them even angrier than ever before!
