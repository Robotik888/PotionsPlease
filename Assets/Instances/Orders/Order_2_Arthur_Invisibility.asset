  - Hello, mister, please don't tell anyone I was here.
  - My father wants me to study gazilion subjects.
  - "\rPlease, make me something that I can just vanish from my dad for some time,
    so I can play outside and catch butterflies."
  - I just need something that hides me from others, makes me invisible ideally.
  <MessagesGoodResponse>k__BackingField:
  - Thank you very much, mister.
  - I am finally able to make my child dreams come true!
  <MessagesMehResponse>k__BackingField:
  - Sir, how exactly does a potion that only makes my ears and eyes invisible help
    me?
  - 'I need to study two times harder today because my dad got mad.

'
  <MessagesBadResponse>k__BackingField:
  - 'I will never go to your store again! '
  - This potion made me two times bigger, so everyone  can see me better than ever.
  - I cannot even go through my secret tunnel anymore, because it is too small for
    me now.
  - Thank you very much for nothing. NEVER AGAIN!
