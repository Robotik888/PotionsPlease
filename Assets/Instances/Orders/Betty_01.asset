  <OrderLine>k__BackingField: The tavern smells rank after last night. Please make
    me something that smells nice, I need to get rid of that stench.
  <GoodResponse>k__BackingField: 'Thanks, my tavern finally smells clean, this thing
    not only got rid of that foul smell, but also freshened it up a bit. '
  <MehResponse>k__BackingField: The smell is still noticable, but at least my tavern
    smells like barf and flowers instead of just barf
  <BadResponse>k__BackingField: What the hell did you put in this thing? I thought
    that smell in my tavern couldn't get any worse, but this definitely beats it!
