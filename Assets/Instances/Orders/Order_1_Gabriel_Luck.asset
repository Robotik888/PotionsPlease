  - Have you heard about that new gambling dice game?
  - I see a lot of people playing it and if you win, you get a lot of money.
  - But I am always very unlucky with the dices.
  - Can you make me something that will improve my chances of a good die roll?
  <MessagesGoodResponse>k__BackingField:
  - Magnificent, I won a tons of money last night!
  - Jackpot!
  <MessagesMehResponse>k__BackingField:
  - I thought it was working. I won a lot of money. But then I lost it all.
  - At least I could feel for a moment what it's like to be rich.
  <MessagesBadResponse>k__BackingField:
  - I was very confident with the potion, so I bet everything at the very beginning.
  - Now I am homeless!
