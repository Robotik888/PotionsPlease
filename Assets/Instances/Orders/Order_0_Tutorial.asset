  - Ah, another potioneer in town!
  - We had a lot of orders coming lately, so new people always come in handy!
  - Now listed closely, we potioneers don't know much about making potions.
  - We simply mix together things that we think might help us achieve the desired
    effect.
  - And the magic cauldron will do the rest of the work for us.
  - And most of the time it works!
  - Just make sure you don't add something that could give the potion an undesirable
    effect.
  - Now it's time to test you out a little.
  - I want you to make me a simple healing potion.
  - Look what's on the shelves and mix up three ingredients that you think will work.
  - Every ingredient also has a short description that can help you choose the correct
    one.
  - Give it a try!
  - Add something that you think can be used in a healing potion.
  <MessagesGoodResponse>k__BackingField:
  - You did it! Good job.
  - Welcome among us!
  - Now you're ready for your fist shft.
  - Come back tommorow.
  <MessagesMehResponse>k__BackingField:
  - You did put some corrent ingredients there, but still some bad ones
  - Try it again.
  - Add something that you think can be used in a healing potion.
  <MessagesBadResponse>k__BackingField:
  - This thing would rather kill me that heal me.
  - Try it again.
  - Add something that you think can be used in a healing potion.
