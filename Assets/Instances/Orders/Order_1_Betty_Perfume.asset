  <MessagesOrder>k__BackingField:
  - The tavern smells rank after last night.
  - Please make me something that smells nice, I need to get rid of that stench
  <MessagesGoodResponse>k__BackingField:
  - Thanks, my tavern finally smells better.
  - It not only got rid of that foul smell, but also freshened it up a bit.
  <MessagesMehResponse>k__BackingField:
  - The smell is still noticable
  - But at least my tavern smells like barf and flowers instead of just barf.
  <MessagesBadResponse>k__BackingField:
  - What the hell did you put in this thing?
  - I thought that smell in my tavern couldn't get any worse, but this definitely
    beats it!
